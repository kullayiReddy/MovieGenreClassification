# MovieGenreClassification
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview This project predicts the genre of a movie or story based on its description using Machine Learning models. The user inputs a movie/story description, and three trained modelsâ€”NaÃ¯ve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM)â€”predict the most suitable genre.
