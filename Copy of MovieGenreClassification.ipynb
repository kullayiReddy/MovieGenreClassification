Her grandson Kesa, who's girlfriend is pregnant, is selfishly happy to see Orin die. Around them, a family of thieves are dealt with severely, and an old man, past 70, whose son has cast him out, scrounges for food. Will Orin's loving and accepting spirit teach and ennoble her family?\",\n          \" Single mother Maria starts to receive anonymous death threats. Together with her children, she flees to her former parental home, where her older sister Ans now lives. During those cold winter days in the secluded seaside house she is confronted with her traumatic childhood memories. But as the people close to her begin to question her state of mind, her assailant closes in.\",\n          \" Lassiter, Jane Withersteen, and the young orphan Fay Larkin were imprisoned in a valley years ago, and now live like primitive people. A relative of Lassiter's named John Shefford goes in search of them. Before he can find them, a Mormon elder named Waggoner is able to enter the valley, where he finds the trio. He kidnaps Fay, now a young woman, and brings her to a desolate area where she is kept with other women. When United States marshals raid the Mormon settlement, they bring charges of polygamy against all the women living there. Shefford sees Fay during her trial and falls in love with her. He rescues her and rides away with her, and then attempts to rescue Lassiter and Jane. When Waggoner pursues, he is killed by an Indian. Waggoner's followers continue the pursuit.
