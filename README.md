# MovieGenreClassification
📌 Project Overview This project predicts the genre of a movie or story based on its description using Machine Learning models. The user inputs a movie/story description, and three trained models—Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM)—predict the most suitable genre.
🚀 Features

✅ Accepts a movie or story description as user input.

✅ Uses TF-IDF vectorization to process the input text.

✅ Predicts the genre using three models:

Naïve Bayes

Logistic Regression

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

✅ Displays predictions from all models for comparison.

✅ Interactive command-line interface.

🏗 Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Machine Learning Models: Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM

Libraries Used:

scikit-learn (TF-IDF, model training, label encoding)

pandas (data handling)

numpy (numerical operations)

⚙️ Setup & Installation

1️⃣ Clone this repository:

2️⃣ Install dependencies:

3️⃣ Run the interactive genre prediction script:

🎯 How It Works

1️⃣ User enters a story/movie description in the console.2️⃣ TF-IDF transforms the text into numerical features.3️⃣ Each model predicts the most likely genre for the description.4️⃣ Results are displayed in an easy-to-read format.

📌 Example Output

🔥 Future Improvements

✔️ Train on a larger dataset for improved accuracy.

✔️ Deploy as a web app using Flask/Django.

✔️ Implement a Deep Learning model for better predictions.
